Hi Bushra,

Congratulations on getting to the 2nd Round of interviews with our company Codes ‚Äòn‚Äô Coffee Tech. We are very clear that with the ability to code and a love of coffee (even tea is cool üòú), humans can come up with solutions for any problem in the universe. 

Our mission is to serve 100 million users with our products and services. Within just 1 year of the company's inception, we have hit 1 million users and have been saving approximately 100hrs of human work every day in total.

To make it ahead and be a part of this mission, this is the task that you need to complete:
1.	Create a college community REST API application with the following APIs:
a.	Login
i.	Email
ii.	Password
b.	SignUp
i.	Email
ii.	Password
iii.	Full name
iv.	Contact
v.	Profile image
c.	User Profile
i.	Show full name
ii.	Contact
iii.	Email
iv.	Profile image
d.	Post updates
i.	Users can add an image and write a comment about it.
e.	Like updates
i.	Users can like updates of other users
f.	Show a chronological news feed of updates
	
2.	You need to build these APIs either in PHP or in Node.js. The database should be a relational DB. You need to create your own database structure for the system.
3.	APIs should have proper format validations and you need to decide on which fields should be required.
4.	Any files like images uploaded by the user should be stored in the ‚Äúroot_directory/assets/img/uploads‚Äù folder.
5.	Once the APIs are developed, you need to create a postman (https://www.postman.com/) collections link to be shared for review with all API links and requests listed in it.
6.	Push the code to the following git - https://github.com/teamcnc/bushra-api-interview.git. The git should include the SQL file export of the database.
7.	You do not need to develop the front end of this project, it just needs to be APIs.
8.	You have 16hrs to complete this task from 12:00 pm, 7th January 2023 onwards.


All the best!
Mihir Rajani
Founder & Director
Codes ‚Äòn‚Äô Coffee Tech.
